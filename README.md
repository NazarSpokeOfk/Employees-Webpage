**Technologies Used:** <br/>
React JS

**Description:**<br/>
This site is built entirely with the React JS library.
You should not modify the public folder in any way.
You may need to remove duplicate files that will appear in your project after
creating a React application.

**Instructions:**
1. Install the repository on your PC.
2. Then, you **must** install React in this project. Full instructions -
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/.
3. After installing React, you will have an extra file App.js. It should be replaced with the file app.js
which is located in the Components folder.
You can simply delete App.js.
Make sure that you have the correct code written in index.js, which means rendering the App component to the root container.
4. Then, when you are sure that all the files and React itself are installed correctly, you can run the project.
5. Use the command in the terminal of your development environment (I advise you to use VS Code)
cd here should be the name of your project, which you specify when installing React in this project.
6. Then, write the command in the terminal: npm start
7. Wait for a while, and the project will run in your browser.

**Additional information** <br/>
You should install React extension on your browser to track the state of components directly from the browser.<br/>
